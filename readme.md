# Simple Vagrant Instance

This is a demo I used for the February DevCoMo meetup. It's a vagrant
box with tags to tag progress from simple to complex. 

## Using It
- Install [Virtual Box](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com)


## Tags
- strike-1 - super simple setup... no manifests, bare bones
- strike-2 - includes manifest that updates the motd
- strike-3 - installs apache and shares a local directory
- strike-4 - forwards guest box port 80 to port 4567 on the host machine


Enjoy!
